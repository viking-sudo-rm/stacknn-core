    Abstract class that subsumes the stack and the queue. This class is
    intended for implementing data structures that have the following
    behavior:
        - self._values is a list of vectors represented by a matrix
        - popping consists of removing items from the structure in a
            cascading fashion
        - pushing consists of inserting an item at some position in the
            list of vectors
        - reading consists of taking the average of a cascade of items,
            weighted by their strengths.

    To use this class, the user must override self._pop_indices,
    self._push_index, and self_read_indices. Doing so specifies the
    direction of the popping and reading cascades, as well as the
    position in which pushed items are inserted. See Stack and Queue
    below for examples.
